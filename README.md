# tor-beans

This is a fork of Subgraph's Orchid Tor project. Orchid is currently unmaintained.

This project has two goals.

First, to update the library for the latest changes in the Tor specifications and to a more recent version of Java (Java 11).

Second, to integrate the Spring Framework to make it easy to "Tor-ify" any Java application.
